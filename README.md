This repository presents an approach for tackling the ’SemEval-2017 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter’ task introduced by Rosenthal et al. (2017). The task is divided into five subtasks and this project focuses on subtask A, which is defined as: Given a tweet, decide whether it expresses positive, negative or neutral sentiment. 

Since this is a classification task with three labels and labeled data is provided, the focus is on supervised learning models. Successful models in the past include Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. This project implements the BERT model and uses it for this particular task. 

To measure the performance of the models, I use metrics such as the precision, recall and accuracy.

Finally, a comparison is made between the obtained results against a baseline model.
